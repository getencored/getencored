- 👋 Hi, I’m @getencored
- 👀 I’m interested in medicinal chemistry, drug discovery and data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and updating my knowledge on spreadsheets. I also attempt to play around Golang.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative research centered on bioanalysis and drug discovery.
- 📫 If it's necessary you add to my repository, I'll definitely read it or I'm @getencored on twitter.
